=================================================================
Amazon Web Services (AWS) is one of the leading cloud computing platforms offerded by Amazon.
it provides a wide range of cloud services, including computing power, storage, networking, databases, machine learning,analytics, and more. AWS allows businesses to access computing resources 
on-demand without the need to invest in costly hardware infrasture.
    Some key features and services of AWS include:
	
1. Compute Services:
   *Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) for scalable rituals servers.
   *AWS Lambda for serverlss computing.
2. Storage Services:
   *Amazon Relational Database Services (S3)for scalable object storage.
   *Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS) for block-level storage volumes.
3. Database Services:
   *Amazon Relational Database Services (RDS) for managed relational databases.
   *Amazon DynamoDB  for NoSQL databases.
4. Networking:
   *Amazon Virtual Private Cloud(VPC) for isolated virtual networks.
   *Amazon Route 53 for scalable domain name system (DNS) web services.   
5. Machine Learning and AI:
   *Amazon SageMaker for building,training, and deploying machine learning models.
   *Amazon Rekognition for image and video analysis.
6. Analytics:
   *Amazon Redshift for data warehousing.
   *Amazon Athena for interactive query service.
7. Management Tools: 
   *AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) for managing user access.
   *AWS CloudFormation for intrastucture as code.
   
 AWS is know for its reliability, scalabity, and flexibility, making it popular choice for startups, enterprises,
     and government agencies alike. It operates as pay-as-you go pricing model, allowing users to pay only for resources they consume
	 without any long-term commitments.
	 
  Regions comprises of availability zone.

* Availability zone means data center.   Consist of one or more discrete data centers, each with reduntant power, networking and connectivity and housed in seperate facilities.

* Regions: Regions are seperate geographic areas, often containing multiple data centers, that are isolated from each other in teerms of network connectivityand failure domains.

* Cloud : Refers to the network of servers, storage, databases, networking, software, and other computing resources delivered over the internet. It allows businesses to 
          access and use these resources on-demand without the need for investing in and maintaining physical infrasture.
        Cloud comprises of compute resources storage, network virtualization and ochestration and management tools and also comprises of security.
 Compute Resorces includes virtualization server we are using which is the EC2 and it contains other compute resources that allows users to run application and perform a 
 process task in cloud.

  Storage is a cloud infrastructure  that provide scalable distribution storage solution or storing data data and files or object, which include data blok storage service.

  AWS Local zones: AWS local zones are a type of infrastructure deployment that places select AWS services closer to your end user and workloads.
