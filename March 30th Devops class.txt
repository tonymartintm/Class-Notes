Releases: in GitHub, a release is a specific snapshot of a project at certain point in time. it's essentially

or versions of a project, such as major updates, bug fixes, or new features. They typically include a release title,
description, and any  necessary release assets, such as source code files, binaries, documentation, or release notes.
Release make it easier for users to download and use specific versios of a project, and they provide a clear history of 
projects development over time.

versioning in software development: 
=========================================
version Control System = VCS: 	A version control system is software tool that helps track changes to files over time. it allows
multiple people to collaborate on a project and keeps track of every modification made to files, enabling users to revert back to 
previous versions if needed.

   The key functions of a VCS include :
*Tracking Changes: It records changes made to files, including who made the changes and when they were made.
*Versioning: It stores different versions of files, enabling users to switch between different states of 
             a project.
*Collaboration: It facilitates  collaboration among tean members by providing a centralized repository where 
changes can be shared and merged.
*Conflict Resolution: It helps resolve conflicts that may arise when multiple users make changes to the same 
file simultaneously.
   Popular version control system include Git,Subversion (SVN), Mercurial, and Perforce. Git, developed by 
linus Torvalds, is one of the most widely used VCS, known for its distributd nature and efficient branching 
and merging capabilities.

what is GitHub and What is GitLab::
Github and GitLab are both web-based platforms used for hosting and managing software projects, particularly
those that use the version control system called Git. They provide features such as code repository hosting,
issue tracking, code review, and collaboration tools for developers and teams working on software projects.
While they serve similar purposes, they have some differnces in terms of features, pricing, and target audience.
GitHub is one of the largest and most popular platforms, widely used by open-source projects and enterprises alike,
while GitLab offers more features in its free tier and is known for its emphasis on DevOps capabilities.
