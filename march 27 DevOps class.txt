FUNCTIONS: A function in programming is a block of organized, reuseable code that performs a specific task.
  Functions allow you to break down your code into smaller, more manageable pieces, making it easier to understand, debug and maintain.
A function is a piece of code thart performs a specific task and avoids avoids repetition/duplication 
how to call a function is function.sh

    Functions can take zero or more parameters, and they can return zero or more values. They provide a way to encapsulate and rescue code, promote modularity, and improve code readability.

To call the function, you use its name followed by the parentheses, optionally passing arguments.    

ifelse statements 
while loops
for loops

if statements:
  synatax
  if [conditions] or (( conditions )) 
  commands
  fi

  example: 
#!/bin/bash
echo "please enter your ticket prediction"
read ticket
if [ $ticket == 2741 ]
then
   echo "you are a winner"
else
   echo "please try again"
fi

filemgt
if [ -e /etc/passwd ]
then 
"it exit. please proceed"
grep martin /etc/passwd
touch software.sh /home/martin
else
echo "it doesn't exit"
fi


function.sh
#!/bin/bash
usermgt(){
  echo "Enter the username of the new user"
  read name
  sudo useradd $name
}
filemgt(){
  if [ -e /etc/passwd ]
then
echo "it exit. please proceed"
grep martin /etc/passwd
touch software.sh /home/martin
else
echo "it doesn't exit"
fi
}
packagemgt(){
  sudo yum install -y
  sudo yum install git maven -y
}
db_backup(){
 sudo cp -R * /home/martin
}
monitoring(){
  df -h
  free -m
  top
}
usermgt
filemgt
#packagemgt
#db_backup
#monitoring

if you run this script with sh function.sh this wont give you any output because you'll have to call the function to get a result. 
  and to call the function the usermanagement, you'll have to call the function from inside the script and specify the name of the function you want to call right under your script in the vim text editor
