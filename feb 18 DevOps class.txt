Linux File Structure :
======================
Linux Root Directory = /


Commands:
    ls       = List the content of dirctory
    pwd      = print the present working Directories
    cd       = change Directory
    hostname = to change hostname you run this command "sudo hostnamectl set-hostname MartinsTech" and to verify you run
               hostname. 
    cat      =reads content of a file
    vi       =is a text editor, when you are in editing mode, you click " i "to insert text, "esc" to leave insert mode and to save your text edit :wq! to save and quit :q! to quit without saving edited text.

 touch : to create a file 
 mkdir : to  create a directory
echo "my home" > file.txt : this command can be used to create a file too. 

bin: = The /bin directory contains essential user binaries (executable programs) that are required for system operations and available to all users. these binaries are fundamental to the functioning of the operating system and include common commands and utilities that 
       users interact with regularly, such as ls (list files), cp (copy files), mv (move files), rm (remove files), and many others.

sbin: = the /sbin directory contains system binary files/commands' that are crucial for system administration tasks. these binaries are typically intented for use by the system administrator or for tasks that require elevated privileges.
      some important system binaries located in "/sbin" include utilities for managing the system's boot process, network configuration, disk management, and system maintenance.

=============can only be executed by the admin-user / root user

What is the difference between bin and sbin directories in Linux?
sbin: are binary files only executable by users with administrative priviledge or elevated priviledges or admin/root user. while
bin: files are executable by any user [normal users and admin-users]

some commands that can be executed by the admin-user / root user:
useradd or adduser
passwd
chmod
chown
visudo

etc: directory contains configuration files
===
/etc/shadow            =detail information about users 
/etc/passwd            =detail information about users password
/etc/ssh/sshd_config   =ssh configuration details

tmp: = is where temporal files are stored
===

opt: = Where softwares and packages are installed
=====

lib: =contains library files
====

var: =contains dynamic files[logs files can be found in this directory]
========
/var/log/massages =the first two are directories while the last one is a file, if you want to look into that as an ordinary user, this is the command to run.
sudo cat /var/log/messages

logs: == :if you want to start your troubleshooting as a DevOps engineer, you want to start from the log file, cos it changes alot, and see whats going on there if its any changes.

proc: = /proc directory in linux is a special virtual file system that provides an interface to kernel data structures. it doesn't contain real files but instead presents information about running processes and system information as if they were files.

=====in proc we have >
- meminfo
- cpuinfo
  cat /proc/meminfo = to get the memory of the cpu you are working on.
  cat /proc/cpuinfo = to get every information you need about the cpu.
  ==========
  as a regular user you'll have to use sudo access to run these commands

  Basic Linux commands:
  =====================

Run task & workloads using commands. : 

Directory: = is a container of Sub-Directories and files

Folder:    = is a container of Sub-Folders and files

=======================================================

Directory Management Commands: 

mkdir     = Create a Directory
rmdir     = Delete an empty Directory
rm -rf    = Delete any Directory
cd        = Directory navigation
pwd       = Present working Directory
ls        = list the Directory's content
  
     Ticket0001:
 Create work directories for tesla??

1.tesla tesla_dev tesla_test tesla_prod
mkdir tesla

mkdir -v tesla

-v = Verbos mode which creates multiple directories at once.
mkdir -v tesla_dev tesla_test tesla_prod

2. mkdir -vp prod/git/maven/aws/nexus/java

-p =  will create both parent and child directory

the tree command displays the content of directories in a tree structure.

install the tree command using the  yum package manager 
        yum install tree

 mkdir -pv class/class1/class2/class3/class4/class5/class6/class7

 sudo -u root mkdir myjob = this created file will be owned by root

cd class/class1/class2/class3/class4/class5/class6/class7
cd.. if you are on 7th drectory of class this command takes you back one directory to class6
cd../../ this takes you to directory class5
c../../../ takes you to directory behind the class5 

and this is a continous process depending on how many dirctory you have on your home 
cd -   = takes you to your last Directory
cd     = takes you to the user's home Directory
